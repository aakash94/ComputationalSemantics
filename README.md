 Computationsl Semantics Assignments UPF


* Because of size restrictions, this repository does not have the weights to the model. 
* To run the code, [download the weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10WQ5JUBaL953Nwpmvd7o-8SRutnxiXiX/view?usp=sharing), and place it in the data folder, i.e. `assignment1/data/`.
* If done correctly, the following file should exist.
`assignment1/data/best_model_state.bin`
* Run `assignment1/ExecModel.py` to run the model on the `CSV_TEST` dataset and dump the results. 
* The accuracy is printed on the console/terminal.
* The generated csv file is `assignment1/data/result.csv`

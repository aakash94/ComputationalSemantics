@ArmedResearch Which accounts?
Does this cartoon means that hatred cartoons to holy values will continue? @BBCtrending @CanAnayasa @LucilleClerc
@Kiippyy @KEEMSTARx is there a live feed somewhere
@HuffingtonPost Can you confirm the reports that those suspects were killed by French police?
@valeriehahn source?
@SkyNews üôè
@FridhKleberg @AFP If so that hostage will be the person best able to give an insight into the attack, if the suspects were responsible...
@BreakingNews @AFP @MelissaBellF24 How stupid http://t.co/L4WURw0G0e
Does Missouri, St. Louis County &amp; #Ferguson have rules &amp; laws about cops using deadly force? What are they? @originalgriz @randyprine
@TPM Wow. I thought a Tweep was being sarcastic, but...it really happened that way?!?
@leonlohr @LisaBloom Yep!! Splitting image in everything except one has black hair and other blonde....
@MrLewis915 but because of the training that cops receive now is more military in manner they react overly aggressive towards us (non-cop)
@Joyce_Karam Is he consider as terrorist or just a criminal person as his faith not Sunni Islam ?
@valeriehahn How many weeks until police interview witnesses? @mattdpearce
@emerhughes4 @ArmedResearch ?????? #whatsthesource
@SkyNewsBreak @UKlPVoter good thats a start
@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Has that info came out yet?
@NBCNews they were well known by the French/ why didn't they do anything??? then
@RichardMadan any updates?
@Tom_sveb @flavius217 I blocked him, so you can leave me off the tweets. I won't see them, gives you more characters.
@BrwnSkinGirly So if someone was coming at you and beating the fuck out of you threating your life, you wouldnt shoot them if you could?
@Independent Just for the sake of good journalism, which one is it? http://t.co/Zk9rA6HylC
@ArmedResearch What media account did you get this photo from? What is your confirmation that this is the guy? DM me please
@JustinGlawe @JesseLaGreca thanks. Now we need a pic of what michael brown was wearing to refute the video.
@NBCNews Easy to know if this is Brown by looking at what he was wearing when he was killed. Has there been a positive ID for this?
@TheAnonMessage2 didn't the manager of the store already say this was not true
@intelwire @ShirazMaher @JeromePio Yes lots of mixed info coming out. Anyone else here about potential 08 prison connection btwn planners?
@Uber_Sydney what does this mean?
@andybankertv @FOX2now Is that the video also?
@XxPLWxX @BBCWorld cos it's not
@_MarkSutcliffe are you inside PH? can we talk to you on Global News?
@BBCBreaking why tell the whole world you morons...
@PD28 @BklynMiddleton Hashtag #kosher shows lots of journalists are referring to it as a kosher supermarket.
@_MarkSutcliffe thanks Mark, Are you in Ottawa? Stay safe
@TelegraphNews @kufr666 got feed in English or Spanish? I don't speak French. thx
@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson No but it def softens the blow.
@DanteB4u Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question 2nd suspect?
@cindyreddeer True. But I hear there was a similar incident this past Monday. Is that correct? That makes me think its low level terrorism
@spants @rui_xu @jlpauk @flavius217 to have the Supreme Court declare open season for cops on the population is a deliberate decision.
@BBCBreaking why aint the reporyers walking accross the grass to get closer instead od tryna get past the police?
@russian_market have you read this? http://t.co/p5s1UG5B9G Is Andrei Illarionov a reliable source in your opinion?
@FootballcomEN if it is unconfirmed, why do you tweet it?
@CBCNews And, ... ? When @CBCNews asked Live Nation why no one made this clarification 4 or 5 hours earlier?
@Princetngirl818 all there is a still picture of a black man walking is that what counts as evidence were they on his person?
@BrigadierSlog @tikikate @CBSThisMorning heard via whom?
@tdgecas @Henderburn Getting the word out about an active shooter situation seems pretty helpful, but please, tell us what you'd have done.
@Asher_Wolf CNN too I have heard @tikikate @CBSThisMorning
@euronews @TradeDesk_Steve A French crime of passion or another heathen moslem atrocity?
@mashable red hat?
@australian @HepworthAnnabel thank god our madness is limited to running around and causing anyone any harm. Hope for a peaceful ending
@xSkylaStarx @ArmedResearch so there's no source?
@KoszikMeows @CNNVideo then why accuse him of a robbery if thats not why they killed him? Whats the point of bringing it up..
@AFP do you enjoy being consistently wrong or is it really inadvertent?
@AFP give the source please
@WilliamDFoster9 @thei100 @Independent don't.
@4DawnMarie @mashable I'm looking for his read hat and his flip flops can you find them? http://t.co/9bVeE3q8Qk
@rachflit @SkyNewsAust you say what? Blackout? How will the hide the budget then?
@RT_com SOURCE????
@Angus_OL Angus!! They havent said anything about the gunman??
@andybankertv @FOX2now Thank you for clarifying. You definitely didn't have to reply to me. Have a great day and thanks for the reports
@drusudy @BBCBreaking jet so many Muslims around the world are a problem how do you explain that?
@BklynMiddleton rather than being a 'lone-wolf copy-cat' the fact the attacker is so well-armed points to a far more worrying escalation.
@max843 Max are you listening to what the Chief of Police said or do you just want to believe lies? Listen carefully http://t.co/zIRh6saMex
@andybankertv @FOX2now Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
@larryelder how many of those blacks that killed blacks avoided prosecution?
@psc96180_pablo well tell everyone you know not to believe it..it's gonna fall apart I bet!
@TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable what point are you making about the photo?
@ArmedResearch @CindyPom Can you DM me the accounts too? I have some choice words
@DIANAZOGA @j03_2 Indicate? If he was a suspect why did the police stop his car next to him and tell him to "get the f#ck on the sidewalk" ?
@ABC
@DailyMailAU Are you sure they have guns ?? Australia has banned a lot of them ??
@tomsteinfort @9NewsAUS There must be a way to enter that building?
wait, does 'higher rate' mean what @Uber_Sydney is paying drivers? #clarification
@KayBurley @PaulineMBarten Killers? No trial? Can you please provide the evidence that these people were involved in #CharlieHebdo
@HaX_FR0ST @DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench So they're claiming a BLACK cop killed #MikeBrown? ?
@mandiegillmor @itsmeggroll http://t.co/FTm8ioZl22

@USATODAY New police chief?
@OZzSue @AnitaTeguh @BBCWorld @BBCNews where are you sue in oz ?
@SkyNews What about his girlfriend wanted by police ?
@DostoevskyShade @AkaDimiX @140elect sorry what now?
@LisaBloom Lisa is he the confirmed robber?
@cbcsaltzman @CBCNews is he alright?
@Reuters incident?
‚Äú@clydetheslyde: Currently the #FoxNews website has zero/........as the three wise monkeys commented 'see no evil hear no evil speak no evil
@SkyNewsBreak Presume they wanted a #Jewish #hostage. So much for martyrdom. Why a kosher deli particularly?
@larryelder @adagioforstring Indeed where?
What is wrong with you @SharriMarkson?
.@PhilSerrin Has that been proven? I haven't heard your news account. Isn't the investigation of account still ongoing? @larryelder
@ArmedResearch Hi, can you tell me where you got the picture?
@1drngju @aprilritchey my 11 yr old would outwit you moron. ..:) blocked
@andybankertv @DavidSTLhss @FOX2now even though his friend and witness to the shooting has admitted to the cigarillo theft?
@DanteB4u @MarkMC9 are they calling Mike Brown a suspect? If so, why didn't he stop them and check them?
@rolandsmartin initially, but found out about the robbery during the altercation
@BklynMiddleton can i borrow your universal mute button?
@NatriceR @doctorfullerton @DaveBeninger ??????
@Slate Who funded/armed/trained gunmen? https://t.co/iPBkLwhQk8 ‚Ä¶ Jeffrey Epstein also in CFR+Trilateral Commission #JeSuisCharlie

@RT_com @MatthiasMeisner Das nenne ich mal handfesten Sensationsjournalismus. Auch von RT. Could you please not annoy me with needless info?
@CTVNews Next, maybe Vancouver, B.C?
@alfinitum Uber is covering the cost of all rides, drivers will still receive higher rates from Uber http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm
@rolandsmartin they've been throwing out one lie after another. And none of it makes sense. How was he "prime suspect" just minutes after?
@leonlohr @LisaBloom and who would blame them when those authority figures are gunning surrendering suspects down?
@mscott Are your reporters 100% sure it is an ISIS flag? Cause that is what is being reported. #facts
.@AngryBlackLady @goprapebuster In a world where white cops who murder shoplifting kids are free of responsibility for their actions.
@lilfer1234 @andybankertv @FOX2now or maybe the police scared him into saying it was michael brown in the first place?
@DorothyKidd1 Absolutely! @DanteB4u @Maggyw519 @orangeseahorse
@YourAnonLive @OpFerguson no signatures?
@my2bits4u @DMeralles @clydetheslyde http://t.co/u8QxZ0Dv60

‚Äú@mashable: Uber intros surge pricing in downtown Sydney during hostage siege http://t.co/Hs9OGDzT1e http://t.co/szDW6UpIox‚Äù Just not right
@makeshiftmgc @DailyMailAU Yes I know that hand gun crime is up 55% where I live and they are banned ! :(
@FoxNews why are you not airing the situation in Sydney ?
@avitalleibovich link?
@nicholasderoose Uber trips out of the CBD today are free to help Sydneysiders get home safely. See http://t.co/UIwoom25Bm
@TheSocialCTV Where??? #Prince
@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 Why wasn't Dorian Johnson arrested if he was suspected of a robbery?
@cnnbrk There is no proof yet that the shooter(s) has anything to do with ISIL but A BANFIELD &amp; CNN are already dropping that scare message
It's a strategy to manipulate media and misinform people. @LisaBloom
@marcwinger @BBCBreaking Extremist rather, no true Muslim will do such nonsense act! The world should know this by now...
@Uber_Sydney that's like the most confusing statement ever. The social media department of Uber Sydney is high or something?
@KayBurley Allegedly?
@mandiegillmor @zadiaz @TracyMo53321503 @mashable James Holmes is still alive. So is the guy who shot a congresswomen in Az.
@DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench How were the police so quick to indicate Mike Brown if all of this took place in a matter of minutes?
@KoszikMeows @CNNVideo to make him look like the bad guy.. Since there is no real reason for why they did it.
Gelukkig! ‚Äú@BuzzFeedNews: 5 Hostages Escape Sydney Cafe Siege ‚Äî Live Updates From @BuzzFeedOz http://t.co/LtkNnkZR4t http://t.co/HrkdkuiGGY‚Äù

@ROCKthusiast maybe tomorrow?
@JFXM wats happening?@AbuSaalihah1
@RamCNN @20committee any timeline on when the general public gets the name?
@dailytelegraph You're reporting a report? What's your source?
@AP *checks watch* Need a few more hours for your lawyers to check your facts? lol
@cnnbrk Weren't you reporting THREE incidents earlier?
@Yamiche @USATODAY - Is it true there was a struggle in the squad car, before shooting?
@FoxNews cc @viswanth183
@BigBadBeardBoy @RT_com They have also evacuated Sydney state library but I have no idea why #Sydneysiege
@BklynMiddleton The pause button is broken and there is no rewind function. It's terrifying when you think about it.
@ArmedResearch Many here in Ottawa media looking for the source of this photo.
RT @AP: Hostage situation erupts in Sydney cafe, Australian prime minister says it may be "politically motivated" http://t.co/Gh8BB9NEwM
@Uber_Sydney Trying to get in contact, anyone at the phones?
@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu dude, come on. This rogue cop apparently thought he was Judge Dredd and murdered an unarmed kid.
@CBCNews good :-)
@CBCAlerts @CBC is it over or are they still looking for the gunmen?
@Henderburn I'm a Photo Editor @ ABC- Would you be willing to share this with all ABC News platforms and with partners if we credit?
@cldaymon @intelwire @ShirazMaher Honestly, we need to wait official statement and investigations. By now, we all talk about rumors. :)
@BBCBreaking by any chance does that printing business actually print the Charlie Hebdo newspaper?
@KristyMayr7 @maddychipendale Have you actually confirmed its an ISIS flag or are you talking shit
@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What? No it isn't. There is definitely no justification for deadly force once he was running.
@princekhattab @RobPulseNews Have you seen this?
@juliamacfarlane @fattysaid Really? Is that confirmed?
@SkyNews I thought there was two hostage takers?
@ArmedResearch Could you tell us your source please?
@CBCNews üò± why!!!
@Howie_Dee @BBCWorld still extremely confusing. Why a CAFE in AUSTRALIA. It doesn't make sense
@WilliamsJon @Sassafras_Knob maintain high level of vigilance? Against who? Obama said islamic terrorists don't exist in America remember?
@aenk963 @BlogsofWar yes, but CSIS can't watch that many 24/7
@AnonymousPress is this photo from last night?? Please clarify because you are using present tense.
@FoxNews Was he saying "hands up don't shoot"? Police overreaction? People are glad the police are there when they are in trouble.
@fairyofbloom Hoping for a safe and speedy resolution. Praying no one is hurt but that seems unlikely considering.
@ShirazMaher @NickKristof It is a separate incident but the same #terrorist cell?
@BBCWorld did shooting not happen in paris
@Henderburn Will do! Would you Prefer your name or your handle?
@cnnbrk we need d I.D of the shooter
@ArmedResearch SOURCE plz :)
@smh hardly myths. Merely poor, unconfirmed reporting. #sydneysiege
@AP Politically Motivated? Really? Why's that then?
@TelegraphNews more to come??? more than 2 boys???
@SkyNews why have these worthless pricks not been taken out yet ?
@ZerlinaMaxwell @TopCat_TC You're CHOOSING to talk about a "robbery" based on a tape that only shows a confrontation not a crime. So stop!
@spants @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 If he was shot in the chest how was he running away?
@Uber_Sydney so free or surge pricing? #confused
@Russell_Barth @dmatthewmillar @devo1400 @spaikin Ah true. Problem now is we'll probably only get coroner's details üòÅ they won't make it.
@BBCWorld #JeSuisCharlie NO. We are witness on how the world have let terrorist walk on our streets. Why they were out of Jail? The Media

@Cdn_Bowhunter @CBCAlerts @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau exactly so why did you or your friend already pointed the fingers at Muslims #ignorantmuch
@Joyce_Karam @LibyaLiberty Why was this mad man not behind bars? Ugh
@Mr_Odin @Uber_Sydney What do you pay your drivers?
@Reuters Can you clarify - are the six hostages and one seriously wounded in addition to the reports of two killed?
@jlpauk @Tom_sveb @rui_xu @flavius217 What they did today was also a good way to taint the jury pool.
@ABC Really? The motive is unknown? Does the flag in the window provide any possible clue? Do you employ the world's worst reporters?
@jlpauk @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 an investigative report on the shooting?
@leonlohr @LisaBloom Shoving a clerk means you'll take on a police officer with a gun? #SoundLogic #YesThisIsSarcasm #MikeBrown

@vanemaya I think we don't have enough facts about the big picture right now (AQAP/ISIS etc), we'll need to wait and see @NickKristof
@Ahmed__Hussain_ @ummsalama15_ One definition? A person that thinks its ok to decapitate innocent journalists / aid workers
@AvitalLeibovich I assume you mean niece?
@Uber_Sydney Yes, that's excellent. What is the wait time for a ride out of the Sydney CBD right now? Are rides available right now?
@DanteB4u You were correct yesterday! Ferguson police chief: Officer didn't stop Brown as robbery suspect http://t.co/B2xRBEfjNQ
@bristola48 Makes me wonder since robbery report filled out day later. Also was cigarillo value raised? @orangeseahorse @DanteB4u @Alasscan_

@CTVNews he's still alive???
@DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench Antonio French tweeted this vid 4 days ago. Is this the same robbery and market? https://t.co/uzi36hP9Zo
@cnni I thought police asked media not to report demands. Why you giving these terrorists a voice?
@inky_mark @CP24 as part of a co-op criminal investigation one would http://t.co/oEZ9w7goVi doesn't need facts to write stories it appears.
@tomsteinfort @Channel9 Do we know the person has a gun?
@Uber_Sydney @mtats so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers?
@lucethoughts @774melbourne does it mean the hostage crisis is over ?
@BBCWorld @Glinner who could be doing this? And why? Don't expect bbc to tell you
@Henderburn why are there no police ??
@KayBurley what about the hostage hopefully still alive.
@GdurhamGarrett @iRondrea @nickk330 ok, have you seen the video?
@CBCAlerts Has car-jacking by suspects been confirmed? Questionable.
@Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu @flavius217 Was he shot in the chest or back? From 35' away or 3' away? Which wounds came first?
@cnnbrk @OutFrontCNN Out of respect for his family could CNN please stop showing pictures and video of people performing CPR on him?
@snowytristan , Hi Betty.. You are in Australia?
@NicoleWill100 @Uber_Sydney It is an illegal bloody service. Why don't you thank regular taxi drivers? Encouraging theft are we?
@andybankertv @FOX2now why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an explanation
@Slate @zaidbenjamin Identified themselves ? You having a laugh, so how come they didn't get shot too ? :/ #France
@ShirazMaher Thank you, Shiraz. I understand. What do you each think about all this? What is your reaction? @NickKristof
@mashable is that Mike Brown? the guy in these pics looks a lot bigger than the pics of Mike Brown in prior still photos released?
@Henderburn Hi Peter, this is Marta, reporter from Demotix. Did you take the photo? Would be ok for us to use? Can you send it? thanks
@clydetheslyde Na, it's too many black people for #FoxNews to care
@FoxNews only just decided to air this have you?? Jeez
@mscott Any danger of leaving it off for good?? Expats are shut out by the ABC. Missing quality shows.
@DIANAZOGA @AntonioFrench Ironic since all the i witnesses say the officer was white. Now it is the black officer Darren Wilson who shot??
@Andrew_Denney @charlescwcooke @instapundit so we still not sure of the motivation for the attack?
@PrisonPlanet minor looting? Didn't they burn down a store?
@Uber_Sydney who's paying then?

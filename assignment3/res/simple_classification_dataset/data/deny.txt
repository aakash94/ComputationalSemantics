@WSJ I did not think the French knew what a gun was or how to use one. There arms expertise was on par with the Italians-experts at dropping
Background see the French deep state. @mjrharris
@AP Actually, he said "We don't know if it's politically motivated". Check your facts, guys. #sydneysiege
@DaliaChai @cnnbrk u r not getting my point -monsters must be penalized. But entire society need to be responsible and not provoke monsters
@irishspy Russian Emb denies. RT @RussianEmbassy 13 min @Marcus_Reynolds This is not true.// I have more time for speculation@jimgeraghty
@KristyMayr7 @theleadernews not ISIS flags
@kellyoxford @HDMcC maybe you should have a news crew on retainer just in case. Rapid deploy anywhere breaking news happens.
@NijatK @VegasRebs So you don't agree anyone should own a gun but yet when something bad happens you're going to call a cop.. That has a gun
@TheRoot @thedailybeast Um... they told just one lie on a specific day?
@SkyNewsBreak wow and you were so sure there was no connection despite having no info. Tell us the news not your view as news. Numpties.
Funny. Unfortunately wrestling a cops gun away would have gotten you shot 50 yrs ago &amp; it will get you shot 50 yrs from now. @TheDailyEdge
.@thelittleidiot a 300lbs aggressive young man might get shot if he attacks a cop.
@flavius217 @Tom_sveb @spants @rui_xu I do, but do you have a basic understanding of the judicial system? Let's hear both sides then decide.
@Independent all reports say 13
@KristyMayr7; several of your tweets are either wrong or misleading. Please hold yourself to higher journalism standards!
@DaveBeninger @SheilaGunnReid Canadian news contradicts this
.@AkaDimiX @140elect B/c that's the obvious lie. Everything else theoretically could've happened. But 6'4, 290 pound man is no "kid".
@hassanbasmer @Chusid2015 @cnnbrk BS. NO other religion teaches that it's great to kill everyone else for whatever stupid reason islamics do
@TracyMo53321503 @zadiaz @mashable you are saying that's mike brown in the picture? It's not. Two events unconnected. What's your point?
@kornegay_danna @FoxNews has nothing to do with what ISIS or Al Queda will do in the future. They laugh AMERICANS are such pussies &amp; whining
@davidleyes @EntCity: I'm crying as well... Don't you worry!
@RT_com they will not die as martys - they will die as the dogs that they are. Only hellfire will await them.
@ivoirien_com @CBCAlerts Can you lay off the politics right now? We know *nothing* about who did this, what's going on.
Srry the whole holding the hostages &amp; threatening to kill them made me think it's extreme @ImKamakase my bad. Jk ur dumb!
@psc96180_pablo @1drngju CIA FAKE PROFILE ONLY KNOW HOW TO INSULT THE TRUTH! #FALSEFLAG #SYDNEYSIEGE
@mashable That person does not look 18. It actually looks a lot like a looter with their face covered that was photographed by @PDPJ
@TheAnonMessage2 this isn't him clearly
@theprawnatron @cnnbrk you,baboon, US media rejected to reprint those pictures finding them insulting.So go and fuck yourself u stupid boy
@zhuravkov67 Hey buddy, I'm still insulting your faith and there's nothing you can do about it. Now go fuck yourself, loser.
@DaryusAzad @JustinTrudeau I never blamed Muslims for this, I don't think you should be pushing vote liberal bullshit at a time like this.
@bloggi @BBCWhat a Fuck head u are
‚Äú@RichardMadan: BREAKING - Shooting on Parliament Hill. RCMP have weapons drawn #cdnpoli http://t.co/VSOYzKOTaV‚Äù
@Russell_Barth @dmatthewmillar @devo1400 @spaikin 2/2 If it did, every guy in the NHL would be institutionalized.
@JSchoenberger7 @TheAnonMessage not an Isis flag. Just an Islamic one. Stop spreading false rumors.
Yeah it's sad when your family gets it. Idiot. ‚Äú@AyyBant: @LobittaT @FootballcomEN https://t.co/hepUeNtotN he has its so sad‚Äù
@kellyoxford please wait on this. Also sounds like multiple suspects. People need to stay vigilant.
@kristinpuhl If you don't think there is clear motive in fighting or fleeing from police after robbery, you are a fucking moron. #Ferguson
@mythos_man @CBCAlerts @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau wow you are dumber that I thought. Haven't you asked why Canada want in danger before?
Glad to hear this is just a rumour. Disgusting whoever made this up. Apologies to @MichaelEssien and for any offence caused.
